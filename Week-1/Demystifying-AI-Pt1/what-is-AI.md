**What is AI?**

Artificial Intelligence (or AI) is a broad field within computer science that’s all about creating software and machines that are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. To understand how this happens, let’s use an analogy (text in brackets connects the analogy to how AI learns, so be on the lookout).

Imagine a chef who is just starting his culinary journey. Initially, he had little knowledge about cooking. To learn, he follows various recipes (you can call this **data**) from different cookbooks. Each recipe provides specific instructions (**algorithms**) on preparing a dish, including which ingredients to use, quantities, and how to cook them.

In AI, this process is called **Machine Learning**, and there are usually three approaches;

+ Supervised learning,
+ Reinforcement learning, and
+ Unsupervised learning.

Let’s explore them with our chef analogy:

At first, the chef closely follows the recipes, learning how to combine ingredients to achieve specific flavours. (This is similar to **supervised learning in AI**, where the model learns from **labelled data** {recipes} with known **outcomes** {dishes}).

As the chef becomes more confident, he starts experimenting and trying different combinations of ingredients. He tastes (**gets feedback**) and learns from the **outcomes** - a delicious dish (**positive reward**) or a not-so-great one (**negative reward**). Similarly, in AI, **reinforcement learning** involves learning through trial and error and receiving feedback from developers.

Eventually, he becomes a skilled chef who creates his own recipes. He understands ingredient patterns and cooking methods and can innovate without explicit instructions. This stage is like **unsupervised learning** in AI, where the model identifies patterns and insights from unlabelled data.

Over time, the chef masters various cuisines and adapts to different tastes and ingredients, much like an **AI system that continually learns from new data, improving its accuracy and adaptability.**

In this analogy, the chef’s journey from following recipes to creating his own dishes parallels how AI learns from the data that it is given. It starts with clear instructions and known outcomes, progresses through experimentation and adaptation, and eventually gains the ability to uncover new insights and patterns independently.

If you feel lost, don’t worry…We will try to explain this using another analogy.
