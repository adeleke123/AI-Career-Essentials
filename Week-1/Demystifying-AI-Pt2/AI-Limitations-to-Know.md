**AI Limitations to Know**

General-purpose AI would be revolutionary, but as you just heard in the last video, its development may take anywhere from 5 to 500 years (Are you one of the Einstein who will work on it?). Currently, we have generative AI, which has already accomplished many remarkable feats. However, itâ€™s important to understand the limitations of this type of AI. In a 12-minute video, MKBHD (A popular Tech YouTuber) discusses these limitations, particularly in Bing. Note that you may also encounter some of these issues in other generative AI models, such as ChatGPT and Bard.

As you watch the video, reflect on the following questions;

1. How quickly did ChatGPT reach 100 million users?
2. What are some limitations of AI?
3. What are the impressive features of Bing?
