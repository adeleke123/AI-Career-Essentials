Clearly, there’s not just one way to think about AI’s role in the workplace. It’s complicated. There are positive, neutral, and negative aspects. It is worth taking a critical look at it. We know that AI can create remarkable increases in efficiency and productivity. However, with this comes challenges and ethical dilemmas.

**Here are some ways AI is already impacting the workplaces:**

+ **Advancement:** AI drives innovation, personalised service, advanced analytics and provides data that can lead to more effective and creative problem-solving.

+ **Enable Creative Work:** AI enables people to focus on strategic, creative, and interpersonal tasks rather than “rote” or repetivitive tasks.

New Career Paths: The development of AI has led to jobs in AI ethics, data science, and systems management. It also has changed the day-to-day activities in many different jobs.

+ **Healthcare:** AI has improved healthcare through better, earlier diagnostics and more personalised medicine. The trend on this is likely to continue.

Because AI automates routine and predictable tasks, there’s an undeniable impact on job security for jobs whose focus is on routine and predictable tasks, and this leads to concerns over potential job displacement.

The concern about biases in AI decision-making also cannot be understated, as there are significant ethical questions about fairness and transparency in AI-driven processes.

As you reflect on AI’s impact on your professional life, it’s important to have an open mind, but also with a critical mind. Consider how AI might influence and improve your current or future career. You should also strive to engage with AI’s ethical dimensions; consider how AI will change your work and how it should be used responsibly and equitably. Hiding from these issues won’t make them go away. We want you to be prepared to engage with them skilfully!
