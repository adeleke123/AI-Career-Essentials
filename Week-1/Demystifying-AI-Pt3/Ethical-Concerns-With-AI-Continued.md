**Transparency and accountability**

Understanding how AI works and why it makes certain decisions is like having a peek behind the curtain. Transparency matters because it builds trust. When AI systems are open about their inner workings, users can make informed choices and feel more confident in their interactions. It’s like having a friend who explains their thought process—it just makes everything more comfortable and trustworthy.

A big worry with AI is figuring out who’s responsible when things go wrong. AI can be complex, and it’s not always clear who should fix errors or biases. It’s like having a team project without a clear leader. Clear lines of responsibility are crucial to make sure problems get sorted out.

**Safety and Security**

Just like any other software system, AI systems are prone to attacks or hacking attempts which could result in significant damage. There’s also the serious risk that these systems could make errors or malfunction resulting in harm or damage.

A good example of this was demonstrated by researchers at China’s Keen Security Lab who were able to hack into a Tesla Model S autonomous vehicle and take control of its various functions including braking, steering, and acceleration. You can imagine the ramifications of having an autonomous vehicle that could be remotely attacked and controlled by the passengers in the vehicle.
