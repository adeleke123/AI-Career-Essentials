**Manufacturing - Predictive Maintenance:**

ðŸª„ There are some interesting things happening in the world of equipment maintenance. Companies are now using AI for predictive maintenance. United Road, a maintenance company, has managed to get four times more uptime from their fleet and cut down on maintenance costs. Another marine energy company has saved about $580,000 with just a few predictive maintenance pilot programs, mostly by avoiding downtime.

The way it works is quite straightforward. Instead of waiting for something to break or just doing maintenance on a schedule, AI monitors the machines in real-time. It looks for signs that somethingâ€™s wrong, like if a machine is running hotter than usual or making weird noises, and then tells the maintenance team to check it out. By relying on AI, these companies are making their operations smoother, safer, and more cost-effective.

They are doing this to tackle the rising costs and challenges in agriculture. These companies are innovating with tools like Deereâ€™s Autonomous 8R Tractor, the ExactShot Planter, and the See and Spray Ultimate Sprayer. Their goal is to revolutionize farming efficiency.

AI is being used more in agriculture. It is expected to greatly reduce operating costs for crops like corn, soybean, and wheat by a significant amount per acre. Leading companies using this advanced method are leading the way for AI to be used in farming worldwide. This will make agriculture more efficient and cost-effective in the future.
