**Activity: PICS**

**Instructions**

Your PICS forms part of your milestone 1, so ensure you return to your PICS worksheet when working on your milestone 1.

1. Now that you know what PICS are, it is time to self-reflect using the following questions: 

+ **Passions:** What would you get out of bed for in the morning if money wasnâ€™t an issue?
+ **Interests:** What are you most curious about?
+ **Causes:** What keeps you up at night?
+ **Strengths:** What is your superhero power?
2. You must do your reflection using your personal copy of the Google Docs [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEUdRGH5D37fKGXfN2oK-cby2zu0Rcg3X_U3Cp0PCSY/copy) (Personal Mission Statement Worksheet).

3. Complete Part 2 of the worksheet with your PICS. 

4. Once done with the PICS, keep your worksheet safe - you will return to it later in this module.  

You will see that Part 3 of the worksheet requires you to complete your Personal Mission Statement. Do not complete this part until you have done the lesson on Person Mission Statements. For now, focus only on the PICS (Part 2).
