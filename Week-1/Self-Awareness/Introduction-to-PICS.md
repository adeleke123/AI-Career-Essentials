**Introduction to PICS**

No! We are not talking about your social media pics, so you can put that camera away, read on and understand our version of PICS…. 

Self-awareness is a lifelong journey, and the “picture of you” in your mind becomes clearer and clearer as you collect more experiences and continue on your personal journey. 

But how, then, can you make decisions on the first steps of your careers, if you are still uncertain as to what your life paths should be, or what your strong points are?

A tool that you can use here to help determine what you like and what you are good at is called “P.I.C.S.” **– Passions, Interests, Causes and Strengths**.

+ **Passions:** What would you get out of bed for in the morning if money wasn’t an issue?
+ **Interests:** What are you most curious about?
+ **Causes:** What keeps you up at night?
+ **Strengths:** What are your superhero powers?
Answering these will help you to continue to interrogate and evaluate the path you want to take and the difference you want to make to society as a young leader and change-maker. 

Okay, ready to give it a try? Let’s work on your PICS on the next page.
