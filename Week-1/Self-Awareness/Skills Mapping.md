Skills Map: Skills Mapping
As a lifelong learner, it is important to track the ongoing development of your skills. We have created a skills map to help you track your skills. This will show you how you will be developing new skills during and after the AICE program. Please complete this specialized skills map so that you can:

1) Get a preview of what skills you will be developing and

2) To take inventory of your current skills so that you have a baseline for comparison down the road.

Being able to reflect on and measure your progress as you go is a huge part of staying motivated!

For this activity, you will use the AICE [Skills Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_N42QcmTeCikG3NiCePnsQFLTE8p8FU-lyAZ18Hnpog/copy) to gauge where you are this week as you begin the program. The AICE Skills Tracker can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_N42QcmTeCikG3NiCePnsQFLTE8p8FU-lyAZ18Hnpog/copy). **Create your personal copy of the tracker and save it in your dedicated ALX Google Drive.**
