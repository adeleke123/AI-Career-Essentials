**Intro to The Daily 3: Habits For Developing Intrapersonal Intelligence**

One key objective of this program is to help you develop beneficial habits that will last a long time!

What habits do you have to check in with yourself, become more aware of your emotions and desires, practice creativity, set goals, and hold yourself accountable (if any)?

Did you know that repeated and consistent small actions form habits? And that habits form character? This applies to both good habits (actions you want to keep doing due to the benefits) and bad habits (actions you want to stop doing as they are detrimental).

Next week, you will begin building new daily habits by practising The Daily 3!These are 3 “secret weapon” habits that many influential, happy, and successful people practice, and we’re SO excited to share them with you!We have chosen them because there is extensive research showing their benefit and because our previous students have developed a practice with them and noticed HUGE changes in productivity and attitude.We will start you slowly, so don’t worry!

For now, here’s a sneak peak!

**The Daily 3 are:

+ Morning Pages
+ Mindfulness Meditation
+ Movement**

For this week, we’re just introducing you to each of these practices so you can get familiar with what they are and why they are so valuable. Next week, you’ll begin building skills with the first one. All you have to do is follow our guidance and take it one step at a time. By the end of this course, you will be amazed at the difference these habits make!

We’re so excited for you to get started and to notice the impact they have on your well-being, attitude, stamina, mindset, creativity, and relationships. For some of you, starting new habits might be a stretch. That’s great! That’s where growth happens! So open your mind and get ready to treat this as an experiment. Let’s see what happens!
