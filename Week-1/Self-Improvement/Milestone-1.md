**Milestone #1**

At the beginning of each week, you get a new challenge from the AICE simulation, packed with activities that sharpen your workplace skills and AI literacy. 
Then at the end of the week, you get to consolidate all the activities of the week into one milestone worksheet. 
To successfully complete each Milestone, you have to follow the instructions in your Milestone worksheet. 
Once you’ve submitted your milestone worksheet, you are to save the worksheet in your personal ALX AICE Google Drive.

You can submit your Milestones and Peer Review on Savanna by following the instructions in the video below.
