**Mindfulness Meditation**

The third secret weapon of the Daily 3 is Mindfulness Meditation. 

Over the past 20 years, there has been a huge amount of scientific research demonstrating the benefits of mindfulness meditation: better concentration, greater calm and ease, and better self-awareness. 

The practice of mindfulness meditation does not belong to a given culture or religion. **It is simply the practice of relaxing your body and focusing your attention (usually on the breath), to gain greater awareness of your own thoughts and feelings.** That’s it!

A common misconception is that the purpose of mindfulness is to “clear the mind,” and have no thoughts. But this is not right! The purpose of mindfulness meditation is simply to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings– without getting caught up in them. That’s it! But as a benefit, it has been shown in hundreds of studies that it does help you calm your nervous system and lead to greater creativity, clarity, focus, and insight. Just what a stellar ALX student needs!

Are you concerned that you perhaps do not have the time? Well, as a wise saying goes…

But amazingly, even just 1 minute of mindfulness meditation has measurable benefits! Try taking 2 slow breaths right now and see if you feel even the tiniest bit better.
