**Morning Pages**

Morning Pages is Secret Weapon #1 of the Daily 3. A recent ALX graduate emailed us and said,

**“The morning pages are a hack I never knew I needed.”**

Morning Pages was made famous more than 25 years ago in the best-selling book The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron. But the practice is not just for artists! It’s a life hack used by many successful business people, entrepreneurs, people who create social impact, and of course young professionals! Doing morning pages every day has been shown to increase creativity, positive mood, and big-picture thinking for all kinds of people.

**But, the point of Morning Pages is NOT for what you write in them to be creative. (This is an important point to understand!)**

Rather, writing Morning Pages provides you the opportunity to clear out space in your head, so that your mind is more open to receive inspiration.

Here are the rules of how Morning Pages work:

+ If you can do them first thing when you wake up, that’s the best. But any time of day is ok.
Just get a pen and paper (or keep a Morning Pages journal) and just start writing! You must do this by hand - don’t type!
+ Write whatever pops into your head! Really, whatever’s there. Just write it!
+ Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.
+ If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you
’re off again. Or try “The truth is…” and see what your hand wants to write! Just keep the pen moving!
Write 3 pages.
+ When you’re done, put them in an envelope (or burn them)! But don’t re-read them. Don’t share them with anyone.
+ Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the process and not the product.
