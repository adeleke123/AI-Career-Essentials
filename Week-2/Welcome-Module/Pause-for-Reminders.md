You are going strong! Here is another important reminder for this week:

+ You have a [peer coaching activity](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/r4IVE3QUxALrqIvupPX9xA) this week. Please plan ahead and review the content before the end of the week to ensure you have enough time to find a peer and complete the activity.

+ You are not to request edit access for documents/worksheets on Savanna. Instead, please make a copy by following the instructions in this [video](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/I1dfaz-mEFMQO2WTG-cLTA).

+ It has been two weeks since you joined the AiCE program, and we hope that you have had a smooth onboarding experience. We understand that trying out something new can be overwhelming, which is why we want to hear from you about your experience so far. We value your opinion, and your feedback is essential to help us improve the program. Your responses will help us understand how we can better support you and other users of the AiCE program. To share your thoughts with us, we kindly ask you to complete this short survey.

+ The survey will take only a few minutes to complete. [Survey Link](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/u4m4_RXG4AUDBAi09SADFQ).
