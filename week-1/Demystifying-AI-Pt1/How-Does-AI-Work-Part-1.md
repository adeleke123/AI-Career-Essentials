How Does AI Work? (Part 1)

AI mimics human learning and decision-making processes but at a scale and speed far beyond human capabilities. It’s a combination of mathematics, computer science, and creative engineering! Here’s a breakdown of the key steps involved in bringing an AI model to life. **Click the titles to reveal details of each step:**

+ **Step 1: Collecting data**

Building an AI model always starts with gathering data. This data can come from various sources like social media, sensors, online transactions, images, texts, etc. The quality and quantity of this data are crucial, as it forms the foundation for learning and decision-making. The rule of thumb is that the more the data, the better.

+ **Step 2: Processing and preparing the data**

Once data is collected, it needs to be processed and prepared. This involves cleaning the data (removing irrelevant or incorrect data), organising it, and sometimes transforming it into a format the AI system can work with efficiently.

+ **Step 3: Deciding how to learn from the data**

At this stage, developers decide the specific way that they want the AI system to learn from the data. This involves an algorithm, which is a set of instructions the system can follow to learn from the data. As you learned in the previous page, this process can be supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. Let’s review these:
- `Supervised Learning:` The AI is trained using already labelled data, which means the correct answer is included, and the AI learns to produce similar outputs.
- `Unsupervised Learning:` The AI is given unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Reinforcement Learning:The AI learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions, gradually improving its performance.

+ **Step 4: Building and training the AI model**

Developers create a model is built a specific machine learning algorithm. This model is a program that makes decisions or predictions based on the data it was trained on and that gradually becomes more accurate over time as it learns.

+ **Step 5: Testing the model**

Developers test the AI model with new data the model hasn’t been given before to see how well it performs. This helps understand its accuracy and whether it’s ready for higher stakes applications.

+ **Step 6: Deploying the model**

Once the AI model is trained and tested, it’s deployed into higher stakes, real-world applications. This can range from simple tasks like recommending products to complex ones like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, or playing chess.

+ **Step 7: Continuous learning**

Many AI systems are designed to continue learning and improving over time as they are exposed to new data and scenarios in their deployed contexts.

Building an AI model always starts with data. It’s fair to assume that an AI model is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Quality data is essential in training robust AI models, but remember, no data is perfect. Humans are complex and sometimes messy, and it’s very hard to capture every human essence with just data. This means that no AI model is perfect. As you continue learning about AI, you’ll notice that AI models make mistakes or show bias. We’ll get into how to spot it and address it later in the course.
