What is AI (Analogy 3)


Now imagine the virtual assistant to the CEO of a company. In the first week, she gets on board. She needs to start learning about the CEO’s interactions with stakeholders, the important numbers the company works with, and how the CEO’s meetings are scheduled. This is like an AI learning from a Labeled data set, and this is called supervised learning.

Over time, the virtual assistant experiments with different ways of assisting, noting which methods the CEO found helpful (positive feedback) and which were not (negative feedback). This process mirrors reinforcement learning in AI, where learning is guided by user feedback and adjustments.

After working with the CEO for 6-months the virtual assistant now has more data, She starts to notice patterns and the preferences of her boss. She can now predict and fulfil the CEO’s needs without explicit instructions. Now, this is how unsupervised learning works in AI, where the system autonomously identifies trends and behaviours.

Next, you will watch a video on how AI learn, to further reinforce everything you just learned.
