**AI Capabilities (Part 1)**

What more can AI do?

It turns out there are a lot of different things! But does it do all of them well? That largely depends on the quality of the data it’s trained on and how robust the algorithms used in training are.

In general, though, here are 4 things that AI excels in, usually far surpassing human capabilities:

1. Data Processing at Scale:

AI can quickly go through and analyze huge piles of data way faster than humans. This comes in super handy in situations where every second counts, and you can’t afford to make mistakes. Take financial institutions, for example. They use AI to go through millions of transactions as they happen.

This AI-driven analysis helps detect anomalies and signs of fraudulent activities that human eyes could easily miss due to the sheer volume and speed required. By using AI, these institutions enhance security, protect customer interests, and save considerable time and resources that would otherwise be spent on manual reviews.

2. Pattern Recognition:

AI is good at identifying patterns and correlations in large amounts of data that might be invisible to humans. In healthcare, AI-driven medical diagnostic tools are revolutionising early disease detection. By analysing large amounts of imaging data (such as X-rays and MRIs) from healthy patients and patients who later got sick, AI algorithms can identify subtle signs of diseases like cancer far earlier than traditional methods. This early detection is critical in increasing the chances of successful treatment. AI is quite literally saving lives and reshaping the future of medical diagnostics.
