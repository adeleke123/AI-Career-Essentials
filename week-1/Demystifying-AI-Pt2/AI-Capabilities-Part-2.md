3. Automation of Repetitive Tasks:

AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy. A good example of this is seen in manufacturing, particularly in the automotive industry. Here, robots equipped with AI capabilities perform tasks like welding, painting, and assembling parts with precision and consistency unmatched by human labour. These AI-driven robots can work around the clock, increasing production rates and maintaining high-quality standards, which is essential in industries where precision can have life-or-death consequences.

4. Personalisation:

AI can tailor experiences and content to individual preferences. E-commerce platforms, for example, utilise AI to analyse customersâ€™ browsing patterns, purchase history, and even search queries. This analysis enables these platforms to offer personalised product recommendations, enhancing the shopping experience for the customer. This personalisation increases customer satisfaction and boosts sales and customer retention by making shopping more relevant, efficient, and enjoyable.
