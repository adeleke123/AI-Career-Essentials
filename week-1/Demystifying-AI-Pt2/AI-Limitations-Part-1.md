**AI Limitations (Part 1)**

Now, you should better understand that there are clearly areas where humans are more capable than AI, lets zoom in on some of these limitations.

1. Creativity and Emotional Intelligence

You know, AI really doesn’t have the same kind of creativity or emotional intelligence that we humans have. It can mimic these qualities, but it doesn’t truly ‘feel’ or ‘invent’ like we do. Take AI-generated art or music as an example – it’s all based on existing genres, styles, and patterns, lacking the originality and emotion that human creativity brings. And there’s more to it, especially when we talk about the context of art. Different cultures have diverse definitions of beauty, but AI tends to average things out, usually favouring Western or Eurocentric ideals. This ‘average effect’ means AI sticks to the most common qualities found in its data, missing out on the rich diversity of global art and beauty.

2. Dependency on Data Quality

How well AI performs really depends on the quality and quantity of the data it’s trained with. If the data is poor or biased, you end up with outcomes that are just plain wrong or unfair. Let’s say there’s a tech company with hardly any women on their team. If they train an AI recruitment tool using their own hiring history, guess what? The AI’s going to lean towards picking male candidates. It’s a classic case of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ – or ‘GIGO’ for short. If the input data is flawed, biased, or doesn’t truly reflect the real-world situation it’s supposed to deal with, the AI will mirror those flaws in its results.
