AI has been present in and shaping our lives longer than we might think, and here are some examples of where you might have encountered AI but might not have noticed.

Online Shopping Recommendations: While browsing an online store, the website suggests products you might like based on your browsing history. This is created from an AI analysing your past online behaviour to make personalised recommendations.

Email Spam Filters: Your email service automatically sorts out spam from important messages. This AI algorithm works in the background to identify what is and what is not spam on content analysis and user behaviour.

Social Media Feeds: The posts you see on social media feeds are curated by AI algorithms, which decide what content you’re most likely to enjoy or engage with based on your past interactions.

Voice Assistants: If you’ve used a voice assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant to play music, check the weather, or set reminders, you’ve interacted with an AI designed to understand and process natural language.

Navigation and Traffic Predictions: When using GPS apps for directions (in apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Apple Maps), an AI predicts traffic conditions, estimates arrival times, and suggests the fastest routes based on the large amount of data that it receives from its users.

Mobile Banking Fraud Detection: If you receive an alert from your bank about a suspicious transaction, AI algorithms likely detect activity in your account that they determined is “unusual” based on your transaction history.

Personalised News Feeds and Article Recommendations: News apps and websites that suggest articles based on what you typically read use AI to personalise your content feed.

Smart Home Devices: If you have a smart thermostat or lighting system that adjusts automatically or learns your preferences, AI makes your home more energy-efficient and comfortable based on your habits.

Auto-Correct and Predictive Text in Messaging: When your phone corrects your typing or predicts your next word, that’s AI working on natural language processing and understanding the context of your conversation.

Music and Video Streaming Services: Platforms like Spotify and Netflix recommend songs and shows based on what you’ve watched. These 
recommendations are made by an AI analysing your preferences to curate a personalised media experience.
