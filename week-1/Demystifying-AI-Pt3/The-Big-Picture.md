To get a better idea of how AI is currently changing work, letâ€™s start with the big picture: how is AI reshaping specific key industries around the world.

Healthcare - AI for Early Diagnosis:

ðŸª„ AI is revolutionizing cancer detection at ETH Zurich. They found that changes in blood cell nuclei can indicate tumours. Now, here is the interesting part: using AI, they distinguished between healthy individuals and cancer patients with about 85% accuracy. They even identified tumour types like melanoma or glioma, a first in this field! Normally, detecting cancer early is hard, but this team analyzed lymphocytes and monocytes from simple blood samples, betting these cells react to tumour-released substances.

Finance - AI in Fraud Detection:

ðŸª„ AI can now detect fraud! DataDome, a company leveraging AI and machine learning, is revolutionising fraud detection. Their system isnâ€™t just fast; it learns from past data to adapt and tackle new threats, a feat traditional software canâ€™t match. With its dynamic approach, DataDome significantly reduces false positives without affecting user experience. This is a game-changer for e-commerce sites plagued with issues like card fraud, fake accounts, and credential stuffing.
