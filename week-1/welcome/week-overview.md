Week 1 Overview
There’s a lot of material to get through this week! Take a look at this overview of the topics you’ll be covering in Week 1. Now is a great time to understand what you need to get through this week and schedule time for when you will spend time with this material. We strongly recommend you set aside several hours each day rather than trying to run a couple of major marathon cram sessions. Your first Test and first Milestone are due THIS SUNDAY (more on this shortly), so don’t delay in getting started.

 


Please use the AiCE Week 1 Roadmap provided as a guide to manage your time efficiently.![You can download the guide by clicking this link](https://github.com/adeleke123/AI-Career-Essentials/assets/51156057/d046e03f-f9e0-43cd-91c3-897e8b87728e). Kindly note that the roadmap is a suggested guide, and you have the freedom to manage your time in a way that suits you best. However, we want to support you as much as possible. It’s important to note that all the content for the week has been released, and this guide only suggests the days you can allocate for each module.
